This folder contains all necessary MATLAB files required to implement reinforcement learning enhanced genetic algorithm.
The reinforcement learning agent acts as a progenitor to the genetic algorithm; which works upon the initial population extracted from the reinforcement learning technique. 
With these files, the requirement for the previous preliminary RLGA files vanishes.

This folder contains the following files :
- main_RLGA_COLQR.m
- RLGA_Optimization_Simple.m
- computeLQRGain.m
- analyzeResults.m
- computeCOLQRForce.m
- BuildingVibrationEnv.m

**Execution** : Run the script "main_RLGA_COLQR.m" in MATLAB command window.
